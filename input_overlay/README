I have been growing increasingly dissatisfied with the solution for overlay texts on input controls I have been using, so I decided to come up with a new system which would be easier to implement and maintain. I found this article by Sam Dunn but I found it somewhat unpolished so I worked on it a bit to make it smoother to use. Include the following script in your page: input_overlay.js (and the stylesheet input_overlay.css for some basic styling) and set an attribute "default_value" on the input control with the value you want to display as overlay: <input name="foo" default_value="overlay" type="text"/> And that's pretty much it. If you update the document with new input control via javascript you will need to call updateInputOverlays() to update them though.
